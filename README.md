# Indusbot
A little roobot that replies some of the features of an industry robot with some different add-ons.


This robot has to have industry features as well as perform well on different tests such as sumo or following a circuit.


The robot has two-centered wheels to make the robot stire quickly, four IR sensors to measure distances and to move on its own, a color sensor to difference between objects, a box to keep and transport objects and a robotic arm to pick up objects.
Also it  has black-line detectors to follow a line and a ramp at the front to keep away opponets at sumo.
